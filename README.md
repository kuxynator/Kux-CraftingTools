Original description: [Orbital Ion Cannon](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Orbital%20Ion%20Cannon) 1.8.2
========================

Version 1.8.2 was released May 1, 2020, was tested using Factorio v0.18.22, and was authored by Supercheese, with contributions from emperorjimmy, badway, madmaxoft, bNarFProfCrazy, Danielv123, Yousei9, WPettersson, and Martok88.

Do you have a large, late-game megabase and wish there were more cool things you could build? Do you wish you could do more with the rockets you launch? Do you really hate biters? If so, then this mod is for you!
Build a giant ion cannon and launch it into orbit with a rocket, wait for it to charge up, and then you're ready to call down the thunder on those pesky aliens.
Simply click anywhere with your targeting device and watch the total annihilation ensue.
(If you've played the Command & Conquer series of games, you're bound to recognize many features similar to the GDI's Ion Cannons.)

You can click on the button added at the top of your screen (or use the hotkey, "I" by default) to check on the status of your ion cannons in orbit.

If you like, you can even automate the destruction of enemy nests by researching Auto-Targeting, which will utilize your radars to scan for enemy nests and automatically fire an ion cannon.

This mod is aware of Bob's mods and will update its recipes and technology requirements if Bob's Electronics, Tech, Warfare, and/or Power mods are installed.

This mod also has configuration options available through the in-game mod options menu (Options -> Mods). There you may adjust myriad parameters such as:

-The cooldown time for the ion cannons, their damage amounts and blast radii
-Select which announcer voice you want (Original C&C, Tiberian Sun EVA, or Tiberian Sun CABAL)
-Toggle the "Ion cannon ready" etc. voices and klaxon sounds on/off
-The time it takes between designating a target and the ion cannon firing
-Whether Auto-Targeting should target Worms in addition to Spawners
-Disable the intense flames caused by ion cannon blasts, removing the chance to cause wildfires.

... and more!

Modding Details:
----------------

This mod implements two custom events: on_ion_cannon_targeted & on_ion_cannon_fired, which can function just like other lua events (https://wiki.factorio.com/index.php?title=Lua/Events)
In order to use them in another mod, you should use the following code:

    script.on_event(remote.call("orbital_ion_cannon", "on_ion_cannon_targeted"), function(event)
        ...
    end)

or

    script.on_event(remote.call("orbital_ion_cannon", "on_ion_cannon_fired"), function(event)
        ...
    end)

Where the "..." can be any code of your choosing. The following variables are available when using these custom events:

    event.force                The force whose ion cannon is firing (only for the targeted event)
    event.surface            The surface on which the ion cannon is firing
    event.player_index        The player index of who fired the ion cannon (only if manually targeted by a player)
    event.position            The position at which the ion cannon is firing
    event.radius            The radius of the ion cannon blast

There is also a remote call that targets the ion cannon:

    remote.call("orbital_ion_cannon", "target_ion_cannon", force, position, surface, player)

You must supply a force, position, and surface, but the final argument -- player -- is optional; if you include it, some extra information can be messaged to the player. Calling this function will return true if the ion cannon is successfully targeted or false if targeting was unsuccessful.
